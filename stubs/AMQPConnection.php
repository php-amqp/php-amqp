     *      'password' => amqp.password Password. Note: Max 128 characters.

     *      Connection tuning options (see http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#connection.tune for details):

     *                       0 means the server does not want a heartbeat. Note, librabbitmq has limited heartbeat support,
     *                       which means heartbeats checked only during blocking calls.
